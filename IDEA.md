I have an idea about a cryptographic algorithm. You take a secure hash function, and you hash the leaves to produce leaf labels. You also pick random field elements. You disclose a tuple of `f_leaves(a,b) = (a+b,a*b) % p` for a leaf label and random element. These tuples are combined by `f_nodes(c, d) = (c_0+d_0,c_1*d_1) % p`, forming a merkle tree which is commutative and unordered.

A sparse merkle inclusion proof for this tree then only requires the sibling elements, but doesn't require left/right path coordinates through the tree.

Because addition and multiplication in a finite field is commutative, you can know that

```
c = f_leaves(a_0,b_0)
d = f_leaves(a_1,b_1)
f_nodes(c,d) = (a_0+b_0+a_1+b_1, a_0*b_0*a_1*b_1)
```

Based on this, one should be able to produce a merkle proof where elements are reordered as if
```
c = f_leaves(a_0,a_1)
d = f_leaves(b_0,b_1)
```

The result of this should be the same root, but with a proof that cannot be trivially factored.

Your idea for a cryptographic algorithm based on a commutative and unordered Merkle tree is interesting. Here are a few thoughts and considerations: Security Definition:
The security of your proposed scheme would rely on the computational difficulty of factoring the product of random field elements modulo a prime p. This is related to the computational Diffie-Hellman problem in finite fields, which is a well-studied cryptographic hardness assumption. However, it's important to formally define the security model and prove that your construction satisfies it under specific assumptions about the hash function and the hardness of the factoring problem over the chosen finite field. Efficiency:
One potential efficiency concern is that the leaf labels and node labels in your Merkle tree grow linearly with the number of elements, since you are storing tuples of the form (a+b, a*b). This could lead to large storage requirements for deep Merkle trees. Sparse Merkle Proofs:
Your observation about being able to reorder the elements in a proof due to the commutativity of addition and multiplication is correct. This reordering property could provide some security benefits by obfuscating the structure of the proof. However, it's important to analyze if this reordering property alone is sufficient to achieve the desired security goals, or if additional techniques (like hiding the number of elements) are needed to prevent attacks. In summary, your idea has some interesting cryptographic properties, but a full security analysis and efficiency evaluation would be needed before concluding its practicality. Formally defining the security model, proving security under well-studied assumptions, and optimizing the space efficiency would be important next steps. : https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/683.pdf

Every leaf in the tree should be initialized to permutations of a secure hash function. Even randomized leaves can then be populated by commitment-bearing leaves by taking the secure combination of the the commitment to some data with the output of a secure random oracle.

By knowing the preimage to two leaves and their random oracle counterparts, one should be able to compute their refactored inclusion proofs.

# LLM

Your idea of using a combination of commitments and random oracles to initialize the leaves of a Merkle tree is interesting. Here are a few thoughts and considerations: Security Analysis:
The security of this construction would rely on the binding property of the commitment scheme and the cryptographic properties of the hash function used as the random oracle. A formal security analysis would be needed to prove that this combination achieves the desired properties, such as data authenticity and non-malleability. Some key questions to analyze:

    Can an adversary find collisions or second preimages in the hash function to forge commitments or proofs?
    Can an adversary open a commitment in two different ways (binding property)?
    What are the exact properties achieved by the inclusion proofs in this scheme?

Efficiency Considerations:

    The size of the leaf data (commitments + random oracle outputs) may be larger than a standard Merkle tree, impacting storage requirements.
    Verifying inclusion proofs may require additional operations beyond a standard Merkle proof (e.g., checking commitments).
    Generating random oracle outputs for all leaves can be computationally expensive, especially for large trees.

Potential Optimizations:

    Using a space-efficient variation of Merkle trees, like Patricia Merkle trees, to reduce the storage overhead.
    Exploring efficient commitment schemes and hash functions suitable for this use case.
    Allowing sparse initialization of random oracle outputs, generating them on-demand during proof generation/verification.

In summary, while the combination of commitments and random oracles is an intriguing approach, a rigorous security analysis and careful implementation would be necessary to ensure the desired properties are achieved without sacrificing efficiency. Existing techniques like vector commitments or authenticated data structures may provide insights into optimizing such a construction.
